# Natural Language Processing Fundamentals

This repository contains practical works completed during the second year course "SD-TSIA214: Machine Learning for Text Mining" at Télécom Paris.

## Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to automatic text processing, covering topics from numerical text representation to basic machine learning algorithms developed for these representations. It focuses on pre-deep learning methods of natural language processing and aims to contextualize the development of deep learning in this field.

### Key Objectives

- Explain the challenges associated with language data as text and related tasks
- Understand various methods of numerically representing text and basic machine learning methods for classical applications
- Comprehend the factors contributing to the success of neural networks in representing and processing language data
- Apply these methods to several simple tasks using Python and specialized libraries (NLTK, Gensim, Scikit-learn)

## Practical Works

1. **Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews**
   - Introduction to NLP, text representations, and Language Modeling

2. **Text Segmentation using Hidden Markov Models**
   - Application of HMMs in text segmentation tasks

3. **Neural Models for Language Modeling and Word Embeddings**
   - Exploration of neural approaches to language modeling and word representation

4. **Structured Prediction in NLP (HMM POS Tagging)**
   - Implementation of Hidden Markov Models for Part-of-Speech tagging

## Technologies Used
